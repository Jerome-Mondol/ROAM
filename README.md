# ROAM
**Robotics Orientation Autonomy Mapping**

Hey there! 👋  

I’m building **ROAM**, a simple little robotics bot that can navigate on its own and map its surroundings. The best part? You can build one too! This project is fully **open-source**, so anyone can jump in, tinker around, and have some fun.  

## 🚀 Why You’ll Love ROAM
- Learn robotics hands-on without overcomplicating things  
- Play with autonomous navigation and sensors  
- Perfect for students, hobbyists, or anyone who just loves making cool stuff  

## 📦 What’s in the Box
- Arduino + ESP code ready to go  
- Step-by-step hardware setup instructions  
- Wiring diagrams and schematics  
- Tips and tricks to tweak it and make it your own
